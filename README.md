# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff-Projects
Learning Python with Automate the Boring Stuff exercises and examples

Public repository for projects I create, while I work on the projects I try to deviate, ask questions, and try new apporaches to impprove the original program itself. I detail the comments for each line of code and what I learned while working on these projects. Good practice as I delve deeper into the book itself.
