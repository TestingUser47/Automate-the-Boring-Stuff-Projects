# While Loop Example

X = 2 
while X < 3:
    print('X is ' + str(X) + ' which is less than 3 for the while statement X < 3.')
    X = X + 2 
    if X > 3:
        print('X = X + 2, X is now greater than 3 with the result being ' + str(X))

# You need to use str() to concatenate a string within a number, something I later found out through error.
