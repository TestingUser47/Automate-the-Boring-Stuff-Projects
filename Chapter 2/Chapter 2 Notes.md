# Chapter 2 Notes 

**Note:** While working on my personal blog for hugo I became familiar with the markdwon syntax, the syntax that git hub uses. A cool feature I will go into more detail in my person blog when it is released. As I read through chapter one and a majority of two I decided that I would only document coding projects where I learned something new. Hence, we are starting with one project on Chapter 2 that was at the end and beginning with the documentation of loops.

## What I learned about input validation:
- input() always returns strings
- Use float() to convert to numbers for math
- Can use .isalpha() to check if input contains only letters
- Should validate user input to prevent errors

## My code improvements:
- Added error handling with exit() 
- Used scientific notation (Ex: 1e12, 1e9) for large numbers
